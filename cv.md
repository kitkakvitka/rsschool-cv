## About Myself

I was a Latin teacher at Kharkiv national medical university before russia started the war in Ukraine. I was forced to move because russians are bombing my native city Kharkiv. I had to leave university after all the changes and since May 2022 I`ve been working in the UK for an organization helping Ukrainians to move to Northern Ireland. That project is finished now and I want to continue learning the basics of Web Development and be able to find a job during the next year.

}
```

## Experience

I was learning on the stage 0 course in 2021 and should have begun stage 1 when russia started the war in Ukraine. I have just a bit of experience in programming so far but I can do different tasks related to the adults` educational process, development and implementation of training courses (including remote ones). I also write excellent texts in Ukrainian and English. I hope that my soft skills will help me find a decent job in one year when I will improve my programming skills well enough. I am going to focus on The Front-end development positions but in general, I'm ready to try different roles.
